# English-to-Russian-Translator
## Description
#### This program allows the user to type in any English phrase and translates it into its Russian counterpart. There are cases in which you type an English word which translates to '???' but this happens because of the .txt file we use for the program. You will also get a '???' if you give the program a word that does not exist. 
## How to View
#### Sign into GitHub and run a codespace on the repository, then select 'AssignmentFLEM.py' and run the code to be able to interact with the program. If you are not able to sign-in, then simply look over to both 'Output1.PNG' and 'Output2.PNG' to see an example of what the program outputs.
